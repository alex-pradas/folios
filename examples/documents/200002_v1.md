# Component Acceptance Testing Procedure

(This complete document has been randomly generated my a Large Language Model)

This procedure defines the acceptance testing requirements for structural components prior to assembly integration. All components shall pass the tests specified herein before being accepted into inventory.

## Purpose

This procedure ensures that manufactured and procured components meet design requirements before integration into higher-level assemblies. Acceptance testing provides objective evidence of conformance and creates a quality record for traceability.

## Scope

This procedure applies to:

- Machined structural components
- Welded assemblies
- Procured hardware (fasteners, brackets, fittings)
- Heat-treated parts

This procedure does not apply to:

- Raw material receiving inspection (see DOC-200005)
- In-process inspection during manufacturing
- Final assembly acceptance testing

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Acceptance Criteria | Quantitative limits that define conformance |
| Critical Dimension | A dimension that affects fit, function, or safety |
| NDE | Non-Destructive Examination |
| NCR | Non-Conformance Report |
| MRB | Material Review Board |

## Responsibilities

### Quality Inspector

- Perform inspections per this procedure
- Document results on the Acceptance Test Record (ATR)
- Initiate NCRs for non-conforming items
- Maintain calibrated inspection equipment

### Manufacturing Engineer

- Provide inspection criteria and drawing interpretation
- Participate in MRB disposition decisions
- Update procedures based on lessons learned

### Quality Manager

- Approve inspection personnel qualifications
- Chair Material Review Board meetings
- Authorize deviation requests

## General Requirements

### Documentation Requirements

Before beginning acceptance testing:

1. Verify work order is complete and signed off by manufacturing
2. Confirm all in-process inspections are documented
3. Obtain current revision of applicable drawing
4. Review any engineering notes or deviation approvals

### Environmental Conditions

Dimensional inspection shall be performed under the following conditions:

- Temperature: 20°C ± 2°C (68°F ± 4°F)
- Humidity: 30-70% relative humidity
- Parts shall be temperature-stabilized for minimum 4 hours

### Equipment Calibration

All inspection equipment shall:

- Be calibrated per the facility calibration schedule
- Display current calibration sticker
- Have calibration traceable to NIST or equivalent national standard

## Visual Inspection

### Surface Condition Requirements

Inspect all surfaces for the following defects:

| Defect Type | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Scratches | Depth ≤ 0.05mm, length ≤ 10mm |
| Dents | Depth ≤ 0.1mm, diameter ≤ 3mm |
| Burrs | None permitted on sealing surfaces |
| Corrosion | None permitted |
| Tool marks | Permitted if within surface finish limits |
| Cracks | None permitted |

### Surface Finish Verification

Surface finish shall be verified using a portable profilometer or comparison standards:

1. Clean surface with isopropyl alcohol
2. Position profilometer perpendicular to lay direction
3. Take minimum 3 readings across the surface
4. Record average Ra value
5. Compare to drawing requirement

**Acceptance Criteria:** Measured Ra ≤ specified Ra on drawing

### Marking and Identification

Verify the following markings are present and legible:

- Part number
- Revision level
- Serial number or lot code
- Manufacturer identification (for procured items)
- Heat treatment condition code (where applicable)

## Dimensional Inspection

### Measurement Procedure

For each critical dimension identified on the drawing:

1. Select appropriate measuring instrument based on tolerance:
   - Tolerance ≥ 0.1mm: Steel rule or caliper
   - Tolerance 0.01-0.1mm: Micrometer or height gauge
   - Tolerance < 0.01mm: CMM or optical comparator

2. Take measurements at specified locations
3. Record actual values on the ATR
4. Calculate deviation from nominal
5. Verify deviation is within tolerance

### Geometric Tolerances

For geometric tolerances (flatness, perpendicularity, concentricity, etc.):

1. Set up part on appropriate datum surfaces
2. Use dial indicator, CMM, or optical methods as appropriate
3. Sweep entire tolerance zone
4. Record total indicator reading (TIR)
5. Compare TIR to tolerance value

**Acceptance Criteria:** TIR ≤ specified tolerance

### First Article Inspection

First article inspection (FAI) is required when:

- New part number is manufactured for the first time
- Manufacturing process changes significantly
- Production resumes after 24+ month gap
- Drawing revision changes critical features

FAI requires 100% inspection of all drawing dimensions, not just critical dimensions.

## Non-Destructive Examination

### Liquid Penetrant Inspection

For parts requiring penetrant inspection per drawing callout:

1. Clean part thoroughly with approved solvent
2. Apply penetrant per ASTM E1417
3. Allow 10-30 minute dwell time based on material
4. Remove excess penetrant
5. Apply developer
6. Inspect under appropriate lighting (white or UV)
7. Document any indications

**Acceptance Criteria per ASTM E1417:**

| Indication Type | Acceptance Limit |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Linear indications | None with length > 1.5mm |
| Rounded indications | None with diameter > 3mm |
| Clusters | No more than 3 indications in any 25mm² area |

### Magnetic Particle Inspection

For ferromagnetic materials requiring MPI per drawing callout:

1. Demagnetize part before inspection
2. Apply magnetic field per ASTM E1444
3. Apply wet or dry particles as specified
4. Inspect under appropriate lighting
5. Document any indications
6. Demagnetize part after inspection

**Acceptance Criteria:** Same as liquid penetrant above, unless drawing specifies otherwise.

## Hardness Testing

### Test Method Selection

| Material Thickness | Recommended Method |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| > 3mm | Brinell or Rockwell |
| 1-3mm | Rockwell superficial |
| < 1mm | Microhardness |

### Test Procedure

1. Prepare test surface (grind flat if necessary)
2. Apply appropriate load per test standard
3. Take minimum 3 readings in different locations
4. Average readings and convert to specified scale
5. Record on ATR

**Acceptance Criteria:** Average hardness within range specified on drawing ± conversion tolerance

## Functional Testing

### Fit Check

When specified, perform fit check with mating components:

1. Assemble components without forcing
2. Verify proper engagement of features
3. Check for interference or excessive clearance
4. Document results

**Acceptance Criteria:** Components assemble and disassemble without damage or excessive force

### Pressure Testing

For pressure-containing components:

1. Install appropriate fittings and seals
2. Connect to calibrated pressure source
3. Pressurize gradually to test pressure
4. Hold for specified duration (minimum 5 minutes)
5. Monitor for pressure decay
6. Inspect for visible leakage

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- No visible leakage
- Pressure decay ≤ 2% of test pressure over hold duration

## Non-Conformance Handling

### NCR Initiation

When any acceptance criterion is not met:

1. Stop inspection and segregate non-conforming item
2. Initiate NCR in quality management system
3. Document actual condition with measurements/photos
4. Attach relevant inspection records
5. Route to Manufacturing Engineering for disposition

### Disposition Options

The Material Review Board may disposition non-conformances as:

| Disposition | Description | Authority |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Use As-Is | Accept without rework | MRB with customer approval if required |
| Rework | Bring into conformance | Manufacturing Engineering |
| Repair | Accept with controlled deviation | MRB with customer approval |
| Scrap | Reject and destroy | Quality Inspector |
| Return to Vendor | For procured items | Procurement |

### Documentation Requirements

All NCR dispositions shall include:

- Technical justification for use-as-is or repair
- Rework instructions with re-inspection requirements
- Customer notification if contractually required
- Root cause analysis for recurring issues

## Records

### Acceptance Test Record (ATR)

The ATR shall include:

- Part number and revision
- Serial number or lot code
- Drawing revision used for inspection
- All measured values with pass/fail indication
- Inspector name, stamp, and date
- Equipment used with calibration due dates

### Record Retention

Acceptance test records shall be retained for:

- Flight-critical hardware: Life of product + 10 years
- Safety-critical hardware: Life of product + 7 years
- Other hardware: 7 years minimum

### Electronic Records

Electronic records are acceptable provided:

- Access controls prevent unauthorized modification
- Audit trail captures all changes
- Backup procedures ensure data preservation
- Retrieval capability is maintained for retention period

## Training Requirements
