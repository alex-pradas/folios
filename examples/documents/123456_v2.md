# Introduction

This document defines the stress analysis design practice for turbine rear structure components.

## Purpose

The purpose of this design practice is to establish standardized methods for conducting stress analysis on TRS components.

## Scope

This practice applies to all structural analysis performed on TRS load-bearing components, including vanes, hub, and outer case.

# Analysis Methods

## Static Analysis

Static analysis shall be performed using linear elastic finite element methods. Non-linear analysis may be used for contact regions.

### Load Cases

The following load cases shall be considered:
- Maximum takeoff thrust
- Maximum continuous thrust
- Ground idle
- Emergency shutdown

## Fatigue Analysis

Fatigue analysis shall follow the safe-life methodology with damage tolerance considerations.

## Thermal Analysis

Thermal stress analysis shall be performed for all hot section components.

# Acceptance Criteria

All stress results shall meet the following criteria:
- Factor of Safety: 1.5 minimum for limit loads
- Factor of Safety: 1.0 minimum for ultimate loads
- Fatigue life: Minimum 20,000 cycles
