# Overview

This Technical Requirement Specification defines the structural requirements for the Turbine Rear Structure assembly.

## Document Purpose

This TRS establishes the minimum structural performance requirements that the TRS must meet throughout its operational life.

# Structural Requirements

## Load Requirements

### Design Loads

The TRS shall be designed to withstand the following load conditions:
- Limit loads without permanent deformation
- Ultimate loads without rupture

### Load Factors

| Condition | Load Factor |
|-----------|-------------|
| Limit | 1.0 |
| Ultimate | 1.5 |

## Material Requirements

### Allowable Materials

The following materials are approved for TRS structural components:
- Inconel 718
- Ti-6Al-4V
- A286 Steel

## Environmental Requirements

### Temperature Range

The TRS shall operate within the following temperature envelope:
- Minimum: -40°C
- Maximum: 650°C

# Verification Requirements

## Analysis Requirements

Structural analysis shall demonstrate compliance with all load requirements.

## Test Requirements

Static and fatigue testing shall verify analysis predictions.
