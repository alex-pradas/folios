# Introduction

This document defines the stress analysis design practice for turbine rear structure components.

## Purpose

The purpose of this design practice is to establish standardized methods for conducting stress analysis on TRS components.

## Scope

This practice applies to all structural analysis performed on TRS load-bearing components.

# Analysis Methods

## Static Analysis

Static analysis shall be performed using linear elastic finite element methods.

### Load Cases

The following load cases shall be considered:
- Maximum takeoff thrust
- Maximum continuous thrust
- Ground idle

## Fatigue Analysis

Fatigue analysis shall follow the safe-life methodology.

# Acceptance Criteria

All stress results shall meet the following criteria:
- Factor of Safety: 1.5 minimum for limit loads
- Factor of Safety: 1.0 minimum for ultimate loads
