## Heat Treatment Guidelines

### Normalizing

Normalizing relieves internal stresses and refines grain structure.

1. Heat uniformly to austenitizing temperature (see table below)
2. Hold for 1 hour per 25mm of thickness (minimum 30 minutes)
3. Cool in still air to room temperature

| Steel Grade | Austenitizing Temperature |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| AISI 1018 | 880-920°C |
| AISI 1045 | 830-870°C |

### Quench and Temper

For maximum strength in medium carbon steels:

1. Heat to austenitizing temperature
2. Hold for 1 hour per 25mm of thickness
3. Quench in oil or water (depending on section size)
4. Temper at 150-650°C depending on desired hardness
5. Cool in air

**Warning:** Improper heat treatment can cause cracking, distortion, or inadequate properties. All heat treatment shall be performed by qualified personnel.

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Material Certification

All materials shall be supplied with mill test reports (MTRs) per ASTM A751 or equivalent, including:

- Chemical composition
- Mechanical test results
- Heat treatment condition
- Heat/lot traceability

### Incoming Inspection

Receiving inspection shall verify:

1. MTR data matches purchase order requirements
2. Material identification markings are legible and match MTR
3. No visible defects (cracks, laminations, excessive scale)
4. Dimensional compliance with order specifications

### Traceability

Material traceability shall be maintained from receipt through final assembly. Parts shall be marked with heat/lot number or traceable work order.
